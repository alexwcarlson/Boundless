                                <p>Typography (from the Greek words τύπος typos "form" and γράφειν graphein "to write") is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language most appealing to learning and recognition. The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point size, line length</p>
                                <p>line-spacing (leading), letter-spacing (tracking), and adjusting the space within letters pairs (kerning[2]). Type design is a closely related craft, sometimes considered part of typography; most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers. In modern times, typography has been put in film, television and online broadcasts to add emotion to communication.</p>
