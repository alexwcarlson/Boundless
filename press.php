                <h5><strong>Michelle Schulp</strong></h5>
                    <h6>Wednesday, May 3rd
                        5:00 PM</h6>

                    <p>
                        Michelle is an independent graphic designer and frontend developer in Minneapolis. Prior to
                        beginning her career, she studied Visual Communications, with minors in Psychology and Sociology. As
                        her work progressed, she also branched into front-end development and user experience design to
                        round out her skillset. This combination of disciplines led her to adopt a strategy-based approach
                        to design, focused on solving tangible problems and achieving real goals based on how people think.

                        She loves the open source community, and when she is not working on projects she
                        speaks/volunteers/organizes at events and workshops around the country. Her passions are
                        communication and empowerment, and she believes in the power of "Why?"
